Note: Using an external vector in selections is ambiguous.
ℹ Use `all_of(exposures)` instead of `exposures` to silence this message.
ℹ See <https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-external-vector.html>.
This message is displayed once per session.
`mutate_all()` ignored the following grouping variables:
Columns `studyid`, `country`
Use `mutate_at(df, vars(-group_cols()), myoperation)` to silence the message.
Warning message:
`funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.
Please use a list of either functions or lambdas: 

  # Simple named list: 
  list(mean = mean, median = median)

  # Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: 
  tibble::lst(mean, median)

  # Using lambdas
  list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))
