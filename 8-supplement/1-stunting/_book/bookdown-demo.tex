\chapter{Sensitivity analysis using fixed effects}\label{fixed-effects}

\raggedright

The primary analyses presented in this manuscript pooled across
individual studies using random effects. Inferences about estimates from
fixed effects models are restricted to only the included
studies.\footnote{Hedges, L. V. \& Vevea, J. L. Fixed- and
  random-effects models in meta-analysis. Psychol. Methods 3, 486--504
  (1998).} The random effects approach was more conservative in the
presence of study heterogeneity, as evidenced by larger confidence
intervals around each point estimates. Overall, the inference from
results produced by each method was similar.

stunting prevalence overall and stratified by region. The ``Overall''
panel includes 22 studies (N=53,194); the ``Africa'' panel includes 7
studies (N=15,756); the ``Latin America'' panel includes 5 studies
(N=2,205); and the ``South Asia'' panel includes 15 studies (N=28,492).
Results were estimated from data in up to 23 cohorts. The number of
children per estimate ranged from approximately 6,000 to 1.7 million.
Vertical bars indicate 95\% confidence intervals.

estimation. Results were estimated from data in up to 23 cohorts. The

\section{Relationship between LAZ and stunting
status}\label{relationship-between-laz-and-stunting-status}

FIGURE TO BE ADDED

\textbf{Relationship between LAZ and stunting status pooled using fixed
effects models.} Percentage of children stunted and not stunted by age.
``Never stunted'': children with LAZ \(\ge\) --2 at previous ages and
the current age. ``Still not stunted'': children who were previously
recovered with LAZ \(\ge\) --2 at the current age. ``No longer
stunted'': children with LAZ \textless{} --2 at the previous age and LAZ
\(\ge\)--2 at the current age. ``Newly stunted'': children whose LAZ was
previously always \(\ge\) --2 and with LAZ \textless{} --2 at the
current age. ``Stunting relapse'': children who were previously stunted
with LAZ \(\ge\) --2 at the previous age and LAZ \textless{} --2 at the
current age. ``Still stunted'': children whose LAZ was \textless{} --2
at the previous and current age. Analyses in b and c includes data from
12 cohorts with at least monthly measurement, 10 countries, and 11,394
children. Results shown in all panels were pooled across studies using
inverse variance weighted fixed effects models and include data subset
to ages up to 15 months because in most cohorts, measurements were less
frequent above 15 months.

month stratified by age and sex pooled using random effects.} Dotted
black line indicates 15th percentile of the WHO Growth Velocity
Standards; dashed black line indicates the 25th percentile; solid black
line indicates the 50th percentile. Colored lines indicate and vertical
bars indicate 95\% confidence intervals for ki cohorts. Using pooled
random effects models, differences were statistically significant
between sexes at ages 0-3, 3-6, 12-15, 15-18, and 18-21 months.

77,129 children) and pooled using random effects models fit with
restricted maximum likelihood estimation.

shown in all panels were derived from 23 ki cohorts in 15 countries that
measured children at least quarterly (n = 77,129 children) and pooled
using inverse variance weighted fixed effects models. 95\% confidence
intervals are included in plots but for certain estimates are not
visible because they are very close to the pooled point estimate.

\chapter{Assessment of potential secular trends}\label{secular-trends}

\raggedright

This study included cohorts that measured child growth from 1969 to
2014. To assess potential secular trends, we plotted the mean
length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) over time. The plot below shows the
individual observations from included studies over this range of years.
There does not appear to be a secular trend in LAZ.
