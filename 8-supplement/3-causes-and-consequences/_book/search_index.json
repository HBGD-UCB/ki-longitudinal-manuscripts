["fixed-effects.html", "Chapter 4 Sensitivity analysis using fixed effects 4.1 Primary manuscript figures recreated with estimates pooled using fixed effects", " Chapter 4 Sensitivity analysis using fixed effects The primary analyses presented in this manuscript pooled across individual studies using random effects. Inferences about estimates from fixed effects models are restricted to only the included studies.[^1] The random effects approach was more conservative in the presence of study heterogeneity, as evidenced by larger confidence intervals around each point estimates. Overall, the inference from results produced by each method was similar. 4.1 Primary manuscript figures recreated with estimates pooled using fixed effects More estimates are significant when pooling using fixed effects due to the generally smaller confidence intervals.

["no-PROBIT.html", "Chapter 7 Dropping PROBIT Trial", " Chapter 7 Dropping PROBIT Trial The PROBIT randomized control trial, conducted in Belarus, is the only study from Europe included in the manuscript “Causes and consequences of child growth faltering in low resource settings”. While Belarus was a middle-income country during the 1990’s the environmental and nutritional conditions, as well as infectious diseases patterns, are different from other included studies from South Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and prevalence of stunting and wasting was far lower. Here, we examine random-effects pooled attributable differences in LAZ and WLZ at 24 months (the analysis presented in Figure 2 of the primary manuscript), calculated with and without estimates from the PROBIT trial. Only exposures measured in the PROBIT trial are included. While point estimates and rank ordering of risk factors vary slightly after excluding PROBIT, the changes are not consequential. "],
