## Methods Detail

We're interested in the causal parameters $E[Y_a]$ for all values of $a \in \mathcal{A}$. These parameters represent the mean outcome if, possibly contrary to fact, we intervened to set all units to have $A=a$. Under the randomization and positivity assumptions, these are identified by the statistical parameters $\psi_a=E_W[E_{Y|A,W}(Y|A=a,W)]$.  In addition, we're interested in the mean of $Y$, $E[Y]$ under no intervention (the observed mean). We will estimate these parameters by using SuperLearner to fit the relevant likelihood factors -- $E_{Y|A,W}(Y|A=a,W)$ and $p(A=a|W)$, and then updating our likelihood fit using a joint TMLE.

For unadjusted analyses ($W=\{\}$), initial likelihoods were estimated using Lrnr_glm to estimate the simple $E(Y|A)$ and Lrnr_mean to estimate $p(A)$. For adjusted analyses, a small library containing Lrnr_glmnet, Lrnr_xgboost, and Lrnr_mean was used.

Having estimated these parameters, we will then use the delta method to estimate relative risks and attributable risks relative to a prespecified baseline level of $A$.
